# Welcome!
I was not instructed upon what to place here, therefore I have taken the liberty to write whatever that goes through my mind as I write.

## This is not a good idea!
Exactly! but it is entertaining, and everybody can use a little bit of entertainment

## So I'll start
There was once a castle decorated with all the finest material on the continent, the exterior is lined with jewels of all kind. The Castle glows even in the darkest night, but alas it is only the exterior.

The Lord of the castle wore the finest of clothing, said to be the fairest of the land but that is only what he shows himself as outside of the castle walls. His heart could not be more rotten,His greed is boundless. He is the lord of the castle and of the land but He is also the lord of the local Bandits. Anybody that does not comply to his bidding disappear into the night never to be seen again, countless knights have fallen to the relentless raids the Bandits has done, and will do.

However far away on the other side of the continent, in a tiny seaside village. A youth barely a teen is about to be thrust into this harsh world, as this youth spends his days enjoying his everyday mundane life...evil creeps closer
